WARNING:ConstraintSystem:196 - The TNM 'sys_clk_pin', does not directly or
   indirectly drive any flip-flops, latches and/or RAMs and will be removed from
   the design.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:197 - The following specification is invalid because
   the referenced TNM constraint was removed:
   <TIMESPEC TS_sys_clk_pin = PERIOD sys_clk_pin 50000 kHz;> [pll_test.ucf(3)]

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:197 - The following specification is invalid because
   the referenced TNM constraint was removed:
   <TIMESPEC TS_sys_clk_pin = PERIOD sys_clk_pin 50000 kHz;> [pll_test.ucf(24)]

WARNING:NgdBuild:1345 - The constraint <TIMESPEC TS_sys_clk_pin = PERIOD
   sys_clk_pin 50000 kHz;> [pll_test.ucf(3)] is overridden by the constraint
   <TIMESPEC TS_sys_clk_pin = PERIOD sys_clk_pin 50000 kHz;> [pll_test.ucf(24)].
   The overriden constraint usually comes from the input netlist or ncf files.
   Please set XIL_NGDBUILD_CONSTR_OVERRIDE_ERROR to promote this message to an
   error.
